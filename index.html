  <section id="about">
    <u><h2>About the Rubik's Cube</h2></u>
    <p><b>Invention and Popularity:</b> The Rubik's Cube was invented by Hungarian architect Ern≈ë Rubik in 1974. It gained immense popularity in the 1980s and has since become one of the best-selling puzzles globally, with millions of units sold worldwide.
    
  </p> 
  <p>
    <b>World Records:</b> The fastest recorded time to solve a standard 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube in official competitions has significantly decreased over the years. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the current world record for a single solve is under 4 seconds. The world record for the average of five solves was under 5 seconds.
    </p>
<p>
    <b>Not Just a Toy:</b> While the Rubik's Cube is often seen as a toy or a puzzle, it has also found applications in various fields. Researchers have explored using the cube to study graph theory, algorithms, and optimization techniques. It has even been used in robotics and computer vision to test and develop algorithms for object recognition and manipulation.
  </p>
<p>
  <b>Speedcubing Techniques:</b> Speedcubers, those who aim to solve the cube as quickly as possible, use advanced techniques to optimize their solving times. These techniques include learning algorithms, finger tricks, and lookahead, which involves planning moves ahead while solving a layer to save time.

  <section id="Cross">
    <u><h2>First Step: Making the Cross</h2></u>
    <p>Cross is a simply a plus like shaped which we have to make in a cube.
      It is recommended to make the cross on white side of the cube.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section id="First-Layer">
    <u><h2>Completing the First Layer</h2></u>
    <p>After making the cross, we have to arrange the corner pieces of the cube</p>

    <img src="Website images/First layer 4.png" class="first-layer" alt="first-layer"> <br>

  <p>
    As you can see the given figures the corner are to be brought above their respective places
     but to do that  you first have to bring then over where they should be located and apply 
     <b>R U Ri Ui</b>.
    Until the piece has been inserted correctly.We have to repeat until all
     the corners are at correct place. <b>Even if the corner are inserted in the correct place, it is 
     recommended to complete the whole algorithm.</b>
  </p>

  <section id="Second-layer">
    <u><h2>Making Second layer</h2></u>
    <p>From second layer you have to use less Brain. There are algorithms from second layer 
      which you have to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
      <u><h2>First comes a algorithm which is used to send a edge piece to the right side.</h2></u>

      <u><h2>Now the algorithm for the left side.</h2></u>

  </section>

  <section id="Third-layer">
    <u><h2>Making the Third Layer</h2></u>
    <p>I respect your patience that you reached here.
      Now the third and the final layer comes. This is the most challenging layer 
      for Beginners.
      <u><h2>Making Yellow Cross</h2></u>
      For making the yellow cross on the top make sure that you keep the yellow edge pieces 
      as shown in the figure. <b>Remember the yellow colour side has to be kept on the top 
        not infront!
      </b>
      </p>
      <img src="Website images/Yellow cross.png" class="yellow-cross" alt="third-layer"><br>
      <p>Your final product after this should be a yellow cross on the top.</p>
    <p>
      <h1>Swaping Adjacent Yellow Edges</h1></p>
      <img src="Website images/Third layer edge swap adjacent.png" class="edge-swap" alt="third-layer"><br>
      <b>This is the algorithm for swaping the adjacent yellow edges after making the yellow cross.</b>
      <h1>Swaping Opposite Yellow Edges</h1>
      <p>Sometimes the algorithm has to be applied twice.
      <b>For opposite matching edges first apply the algorithm while holding as shown in the figure.</b>
      <b>After applying the algorithm on the opposite matching yellow edges you will again have to 
        apply the same algorithm by holding it as shown in the Adjacent Matching Edges.
      </b>
      </p>
      
      
      <img src="Website images/Third layer edge swap opposite.png"class="edge-swap" alt="third-layer"><br>
      <img src="Website images/yellow edge algo.png"class="edge-swap-algo" alt="third-layer"><br>
     

      <h1>Position the Yellow Corners</h1>
      We have almost finished solving the Rubik's Cube, only the yellow corners are left. 
      In this step we just have to put them in the right spot, it doesn't matter if the orientation 
      is wrong. We're going to take care about the orientation in the last step.
     </p>
      <img src="Website images/Yellow corners ok.png"class="corner-ok" alt="third-layer"><br>
      Look for a yellow corner which is on the right position, then hold the cube in 
      your hands with this one in the <b>front-right-top</b> and execute the algorithm below.
       If the pieces didn't get where they belong do the algorithm one more time.
       <img src="Website images/Yellow edges orientation algo.png"class="long-algo" alt="third-layer"><br>
       Sometimes you can't find a piece in the correct spot. In this case utilize the same algorithm 
       for any random corner to bring one to the correct position.
       <h1>Orientation of Yellow Corners</h1>
       <p>When you reach this final step all the pieces are on the right spot, you just have to orient
        the last layer corners which are now on the top of the puzzle.
        Hold the cube in your hand so the upper piece you want to orient is on the <b>front-right-top</b> corner,
         then do this algorithm twice or four times until that specific piece is oriented correctly
         <b>Apply the given Algoritm</b>
    </p>
         <img src="Website images/Final look.png"class="final-look" alt="third-layer"><br> 

        
         
         <img src="Website images/Ri Di R D.png"class="last-algo" alt="third-layer"><br>
        <p> In the meantime it might seem like you messed up the whole cube but don't worry, 
         it will be all right when all the corner pieces are oriented.

         When a yellow corner is oriented correctly, turn the top layer only to move another yellow 
         corner piece you want to orient to the front-right-top corner of the cube and repeat R' D' R D again until this specific piece is OK.

         Keep doing this until your Cube is solved.</p>
         
         
         
          
      
  
        <div class="alert">
          
          <u><h1>Important!</h1></u>
          <p>Many people mess up their cube in this final step because they 
            skip the last D turn as soon as they see the yellow sticker facing
             up at the top. Make sure you complete the whole R' D' R D algorithm.

            Don't rotate the whole cube while doing the steps! Just do a U or Ui turn when you finish 
            orienting one yellow corner.
